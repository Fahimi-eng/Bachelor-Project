# Laravel Bachelor Project

The purpose of this project is that customers can reserve their table and food for lunch or dinner before coming to the restaurant.

Project Structure:

- Project
    - Admin sub-system/
        - Food management
        - Management of tables
        - Manage orders
        - site management
    
    - Customer sub-system
        - Reservation
    
        

To develop a successful restaurant reservation website, it is important to focus on creating a user-friendly interface, implementing an online reservation system, a menu management system, a table management system, and an order management system. Additionally, an admin dashboard should be created to manage all aspects of the reservation system, and a payment gateway should be integrated to allow customers to pay for their reservations online. Security features should also be implemented, and the system should be thoroughly tested before launching to ensure reliability and prevent potential issues. 

This reservation project avoids security problems by using Laravel's authentication system to give the project reliability.

In this project, the Shatabit package has been added to the project to simulate the payment process, but it has not been used for some reasons.
